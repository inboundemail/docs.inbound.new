Welcome to Inbound! Get started with sending emails, receiving emails, and building complete email workflows in minutes.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    Sign up at [inbound.new](https://inbound.new) and generate an API key from your dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install the SDK (Recommended)">
    Install our SDK for the best developer experience:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @inboundemail/sdk
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send Your First Email">
    Start sending emails immediately:
    
    
    ```typescript SDK (typescript)
    import { Inbound } from '@inboundemail/sdk'
    
    const inbound = new Inbound(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY!)
    
    const { data, error } = await inbound.emails.send({
      from: 'Inbound User <agent@inbnd.dev>',
      to: 'youremail@inbound.new',
      subject: 'Welcome!',
      html: '<p>Thanks for signing up!</p>',
      tags: [{ name: 'campaign', value: 'welcome' }]
    })
    
    console.log(`Email sent: ${data?.id}`)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication

All API requests to Inbound v2 require authentication using an API key. This guide explains how to obtain and use your API key securely.

### Base URL

All authenticated requests are made to:

```bash
https://inbound.new/api/v2
```

### Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Dashboard">
    Log in to your Inbound dashboard and navigate to the Settings page.
    
    <Card title="Dashboard" icon="external-link" href="https://inbound.new/settings">
      Access your API keys from the dashboard
    </Card>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    Click "Create API Key" and give it a descriptive name for easy identification.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy and Store Securely">
    Copy your API key immediately and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again.
    
    <Warning>
    API keys are sensitive credentials. Never expose them in client-side code or commit them to version control.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all API requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

### Security Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: Always store API keys in environment variables
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate your API keys for enhanced security
- **Environment Separation**: Use separate API keys for different environments
- **Monitoring**: Monitor your API key usage in the dashboard

<Tip>
Learn about [rate limits](/rate-limits) to optimize your API usage and avoid hitting limits.

## How Inbound Works

Inbound enables you to be able to send & receive emails programmatically.

#### Sending Emails

You can send emails using the SDK or the API. Our SDK is *very* similar to the [Resend SDK](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference). So if you are
migrating from Resend, you shouldn't have any trouble.

Example:

```typescript Node.js
const { data, error } = await inbound.emails.send({
  from: 'Inbound User <agent@inbnd.dev>',
  to: 'youremail@inbound.new',
  subject: 'Welcome!',
  html: '<p>Thanks for signing up!</p>',
  tags: [{ name: 'campaign', value: 'welcome' }]
})

console.log(`Email sent: ${data?.id}`)

// Response:
{
   "id":"nOvWqzU2Geh2q6AfeH1pk", // inbound email id
   "messageId":"010f01990252a2b8-0dcc8a27-a7b4-45be-a290-822f7e509049-000000" // AWS SES Message ID
}
```

#### Receiving Emails

In inbound you can receive emails using endpoints. You can attach endpoints to individual email 
addresses or you can setup catch-all for a domain, where all any incoming email that doesn't match
any of the specific email addresses will be routed to the catch-all endpoint.

Example:

```typescript
switch (email) {
  case 'support@yourdomain.com':
    endpoint1  // Specific endpoint for support
  case 'sales@yourdomain.com':
    endpoint2  // Specific endpoint for sales
  default:    // catch-all
    endpoint3  // Fallback endpoint for all other emails
}
```

## Error Handling

API errors are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

Common status codes:
- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- `404` - Not Found (resource not found)
- `429` - Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- `500` - Internal Server Error
