## Overview

When emails arrive at your configured addresses, Inbound sends a webhook to your endpoint with the complete email data.

```typescript
import type { InboundWebhookPayload } from '@inboundemail/sdk'
```

## Webhook Payload Structure

We have fully a complete typed webhook payload for you to use in your endpoints.

```typescript
const payload: InboundWebhookPayload = {
  event: 'email.received',
  timestamp: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z',
  email: {
    id: 'email_abc123',
    messageId: '<unique@example.com>',
    from: {
      text: 'John Doe <john@example.com>',
      addresses: [{
        name: 'John Doe',
        address: 'john@example.com'
      }]
    },
    to: {
      text: 'support@yourdomain.com',
      addresses: [{
        name: null,
        address: 'support@yourdomain.com'
      }]
    },
    recipient: 'support@yourdomain.com',
    subject: 'Help with my order',
    receivedAt: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z',
    parsedData: {
      messageId: '<unique@example.com>',
